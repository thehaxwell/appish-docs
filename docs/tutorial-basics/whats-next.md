You have just explored the basics of Appish by learning how one would build a todo-list bot.

Appish is still in early development. [Join my newsletter to get weekly updates](https://appish.co/newsletter).

The Appish cross-platform app will be **open source** and built in Flutter & Dart. So let's build this together:

- Flutter and Javascript developers, check out our [contributors guide](https://docs.appish.co/docs/contributors-guide)
